# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	This project sets out to analyze how different kickstarter campaigns performed with relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The client Louise had a campaign for her play Fever and would like to know how other campaigns fared.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The ratio of successful kickstarter campaigns to failed kickstarter campaigns remains fairly even throughout the year except for in late spring/early summer where the gap becomes bigger between the two, and in the late fall/early winter where the gap between the two gets smaller.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	At smaller funding goals the success rate of theater kickstarter campaigns is higher, but at about $15000 is where they start to fail more often than not, except for the $35000-$45000 range but that seems to be because of how few of them there are.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The data can get a bit skewed when there are fewer data points in a range then others, but that was taken into consideration when making conclusions.

## Results

	The months of May and June are good times to launch a theater kickstater. November and December are months that are probably not good to launch theater kickstaters in.A campaign with a lower fundraising goal (<$10000) is more likely to be successful in getting funded.  
	This dataset won't be able to tell the full story of why a kickstarter campaign ended up getting funded or not because there are circumstances less quantitative to getting funded, like celebrity participation, or returning campaign runners having returning backers. 
	The dataset includes how long the campaigns ran for, so we could look at how long the campaigns ran versus their success rates.
